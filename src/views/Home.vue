      <h3>About</h3>
      <p class="description"><strong>Cardiff Electric</strong> is a fictional computer software company in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt
          and Catch Fire</a>, located in Texas during the early 1980s.</p>
      <p class="description">The show is a fictionalized take on the early computer revolution of the 1980s. Although
        the company was
        created for the show, it parallels the rise and fall of Compaq, a real company that reverse engineered the IBM
        Personal Computer to dominate the computer market.</p>

          <h5 class="heading">Gordon Clark</h5>
          <p class="description">Gordon Clark is a once-promising engineer who longs for a redo
            of his past before the humiliating and public failure of Symphonic, a computer he created with his wife,
            Donna, which failed to turn on at COMDEX, the computer industry trade show. After that, Gordon moved his
            family to Dallas, Donna’s hometown, and took a job at Cardiff Electric.</p>

          <h5 class="heading">Donna Clark</h5>
          <p class="description">Donna Clark is Gordon's wife and ex-engineering partner. Donna grew up in a
            new-money family in Dallas and her parents are entrepreneurs who founded a high-end gadget company called
            Razor’s Edge. An accomplished musician, Donna found her calling in computers while attending the University
            of California, Berkeley, with her husband Gordon, where she went into to engineering.</p>

          <p class="description">Cameron Howe, born "Catherine", is a volatile prodigy who drops out of college
            and puts her future in jeopardy to join Joe MacMillan's rogue PC project. This 22 year old programmer is a
            shock to the system of conservative, old-guard Cardiff Electric, but she simultaneously represents what is
            next in the world of computing while delivering a slap in the face to the traditionally male-dominated
            1980s tech industry.</p>

          <h5 class="heading">Joe MacMillan</h5>
          <p class="description">Joe MacMillan is a hard-driving former IBM sales executive who oozes charisma.
            When he shows up at Cardiff Electric, he essentially bulldozes his way into a senior position on the sales
            team. Once he has the job, he immediately orchestrates a plan to reverse-engineer his former employer's
            product and build something better, but his ultimate agenda is unknown.</p>
